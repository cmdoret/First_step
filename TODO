1. Look at distribution of length for TADs, TAD boundaries, gaps between TADs. }for all 3 thresholds, merged
2. define TAD boundaries so that they don't overlap each other.
3. Stop TAD boundaries when they meet another.
4. Divide TADs into bins of 10%, + max3bins outside, depending on neighbour proximity. 
5. Check what is the number of lincRNAs/pcgenes that overlap (by at least 25%) with each TAD bin
X. Calculate and plot the distribution of the median overlap length of lincRNAs/pcgenes to each bin
5. Include bins outside TADs, (10%, 20%, 30%) except if they overlap another TAD.
6. Look for correlation between TAD length and number of transcripts.
7. Sequence conservation across species.
------------------------------
25.10:
1. Rerun usual analyses with new boundaries:
    -subcell loc, expression levels, tissue specificity
2. Conservation across species
3. Is the expression level of TADbound-lincRNAs correlated with each pc gene within the same TAD compared to what's expected by random chance ? Requires GEUVADIS expression matrix. Compare pairwise comparison to a distribution representing expression by chance generated via permuted expression values across samples for each lincRNA (1000Xperm).
4.  Is the expression level of the lincRNA correlated with the amount of DNA-DNA interaction happening at that locus across different tissues and cell types ? expr of all lincRNA in different lines -> download matching hiC data  -> look for correlation between expression values and contact matrix values. also divide into LCL-TADbound and non-TADbound -> look if there is a diff.

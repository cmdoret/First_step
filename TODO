1. Look at distribution of length for TADs, TAD boundaries, gaps between TADs. }for all 3 thresholds
2. define TAD boundaries so that they don't overlap each other:
3. Stop TAD boundaries when they meet another.
4. Divide TADs into bins of 10% and look for number of transcripts in each bins. 
5. Include bins outside TADs, (10%, 20%, 30%) except if they overlap another TAD.
6. Look for correlation between TAD length and number of transcripts.
7. Sequence conservation across species.

#TAD boundaries definition
When defining TAD boundaries as the areas 20% before and after TAD borders, those boundaries seemed to overlap with those of the neighbouring domains. To solve this issue, the TAD boundaries have been set to 3 different, arbitrary threshold: 5%, 10% and 20% of the TAD length.

#Overlapping genes with TAD boundaries
Both lincRNAs and protein coding genes have been overlapped with TAD boundaries, using the intersect program with -f 0.25 (genes must have at least 25% of their sequence overlapping a boundary to be considered). The set of overlaps was then cleaned by removing duplicates.

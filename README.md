This project is performed at the University of Lausanne, as a First step for my master in Bioinformatics.

It aims to study the effects of long intergenic non coding RNAs (lincRNAs) on chromatin architecture,
regulation of protein coding genes and different diseases.
It involves the use of RNA-seq, Hi-C and SNP array data.

The project is done under the supervision of Jennifer Yihong Tan, in the Marques group.

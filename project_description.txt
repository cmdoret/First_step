First-step project: Characterization of TAD-bound lincRNAs

Aim: 
Identify and characterize lincRNAs at TAD boundaries and analyze whether they have a role in the regulation of gene expression within TADs and the maintenance of chromatin organization.



Method:
- find lincRNAs that overlap to TAD boundaries (20% at border of TAD)
	- at least 25% of lincRNA loci need to over TAD boundary
	- denote as TADbound-lincRNAs
	

	
Further characterization:
1. compare expression levels of TADbound-lincRNAs and nonTADbound-lincRNAs
2. subcellular localization
3. tissue specificity

4. enrichment in chromatin marks (H3K4me1/me3, CTCF, cohesion) - (GAT enrichment test)
	- cohesion unit consists of 4 subunits (SMC1, SMC3, Rad21[Scc1], STAG[SCC3])
	- ChIPseq data available for SMC3 and RAD21 in GM12878


5. co-expression with shared eQTL pcgenes within and outside of the same TAD
	- find lincRNAs that share common SNP eQTLs with nearby pcgenes
	- for these lincRNA:pcgene pairs, are they enriched in the same TADs? (GAT enrichment test)
	- are pairs within the same TADs more co-expressed with each other than pairs not within the same TADs
	
	- are lincRNAs within these pairs enriched in TADbound-lincRNAs? (GAT enrichment test)
	- identify pairs with the lincRNA as a TADbound-lincRNA
	- are TADbound-lincRNA:pcgene pairs more co-expressed than nonTADbound-lincRNA:pcgene pairs?

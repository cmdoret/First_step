All tests are two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, $***P<0.001$; - not significant. A. Median expression levels in GM12878. B. Tissue specificity index (Tau). The index can take values between 0 (low specificity) and 1 (high specificity). C. Sequence conservation of exons through mammalian and primate evolution. Averaged phastCons score is used as a measure. The green horizontal line represents the median conservation of ancestral repeats, which are assuming to be evolving neutrally. \relax }}{5}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Schematic representation of TADs and loops and typical patterns observed in Hi-C matrices corresponding to these structures. Center: Example of a Hi-C matrix visualized in Juicebox (Durand et al., 2016)⁠. These matrices are symmetric and only upper/lower triangles are therefore used to simplify the visualization. The darker pixels on the matrix contain more interactions. Left: Two separate TADs are observed as high interactions triangle on the matrix. These are examplified by regions of compacted DNA where frequent interactions occur, while interactions across TADs (i.e. between the blue and green triangles) are less frequent. A and B are the borders of the first TAD while C and D are the borders of the second TAD. Boundaries are the rectangles expanding inwards from the borders. Right: Representation of a loop with A and B being the anchors of the loop where strong contact is observed. Unlike TADs, the contact is not particularly high in the region between the two anchors, therefore loops are seen as a sharp increase in contacts deviating from the matrix diagonal. \relax }}{7}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces Visual representations of the algorithms used to compute contacts in Hi-C matrices. As they are symmetric, matrices are represented as upper triangles for simplicity reasons. A: Schematic representation of the algorithm used to measure insulation. A diamond (blue) of width w set to 100kb is slid on all position along the diagonal. For each position, the sum in the diamond is computed and later used to define boundaries. The sum in the diamond at position d (dotted line) represents a measure of all interactions across position d (i.e. between elements before and after position d). B: Method used to compute the mean of all interactions in TADs. Each TAD is taken as a submatrix (upper triangles of the submatrices are depicted in blue) and the mean value in the submatrix is computed. \relax }}{8}}

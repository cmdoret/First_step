#Introduction

Visualising and quantifying the distribution of TAD lengths, or the areas of ovelap between lincRNAs and TADs might help finding a better threshold for the definition of TAD boundaries. This report aims to provide support for the definition of those boundaries.

1. Distribution of TAD, boundaries and gaps

2. Overlaps between RNA and areas of TAD boundaries

3.

#Introduction: 

Checking if there are correlations between gene expression and DNA-DNA contact across 4 different cell lines (GM12878, K562, HUVEC and NHEK).

NOTE: Contact matrices for chromosome 9 for all cell lines Has been normalised using SQRTVC instead of KR because the algorithm did not converge for K562 and vector was full of NA.

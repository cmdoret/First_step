#Introduction

The largely different gene length between protein-coding genes and lincRNAs made it more difficult than expected to find appropriate thresholds to call TAD-bound and non TAD-bound genes. The focus of the project has thus been redirected to investigate the role of enhancer-associated lincRNAs (elincRNAs) in the organization of TADs.

#Methods:

##Definition of TAD-boundaries

TAD boundaries are now only extended towards the inside of TADs at 5% of TAD length and when TAD boundaries overlap, the largest ones are removed. 

#Definition of enhancer-associated genes

LincRNAs and protein-coding genes whose promoter regions (or promoter region + gene body) was overlapping enhancer elements (defined by histone modification marks) were defined as elincRNAs or epc-genes. The others are considered non-enhancer-associated.
